Hey everyone!!!! You must be wondering how did you end up here. It would appear you are curious enough to click on a link to know more about this guy Akhilesh Kesavan

Well of course I know him, He's me (Hoping you get the Star Wars meme reference), the guy in the photo (No not the guy in the background) about to dive into and relish that scrumptious looking sizzler. I am a final year dual degree student at The Indian Institute of Madras working with Dr [Himanshu Sinha](https://home.iitm.ac.in/sinha/people/himanshu_sinha.html) as a member of the [Systems Genetics Lab](https://home.iitm.ac.in/sinha/index.html). My work involves unravelling
the mysteries around the infamous translator, the Ribosome, with the help of <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>.

A self proclaimed know it all with a constant feeling of not knowing enough, I seek new avenues to learn improve my knowledge and skillset. Be it for work or fun, it is my belief that no information is bad information (locate the pun). As severe workaholic (with high inertia), once I set out to achieve something, I do not stop until the job is done. As an avid gamer, my way of taking a break from the gruesome routine life is to live the adventurous life of an anxious mountain climber conquering mount Celeste or an exile slaying the old gods or venture into a Defence Of The Ancients as the bone fletcher to name a few. When not in an adventurous mood I try to catch up on some reading, relax to the music of the adventures or just attempt to pick up a new skill.

The most intriguing concept of life for me is modularity. What began as curiosity and excitement about the concept upon first hearing about Google's project ARA (RIP), now fascinates me with its abundance in nature. I wish to develop and maintain this ability to develop what appear to be small individual components that can be mixed and matched to generate something greater than themselves.

To quickly summerize, I am an hopeful biologist, part-time photographer, gamer (#DreamOG), knower of things, admirer of wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff and most importantly DON'T BLINK!!!!
