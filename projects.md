**Detecting common mutations in HBB gene by ARMS PCR for molecular diagnosis of Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Anemia**
-----------------

<p style="text-align: justify">
Winter internship at <a href="https://genetech.co.in/">GeneTech</a>, Hyderabad
<br>
</p>
- Screened for mutations in the HBB gene for beta thalassemia and sickle cell anemia diagnosis
- Extracted DNA from patient blood samples
- Identified specific primers to detect the mutations using ARMS PCR and gel electrophoresis

**Detecting number of CGG repeats in FMR gene for molecular diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome by PCR**
-----------------

<p style="text-align: justify">
Winter internship at <a href="https://genetech.co.in/">GeneTech</a>, Hyderabad
<br>
</p>
- Screened the FMR gene for Fragile X syndrome diagnosis
- Extracted DNA from patient tissue samples
- Estimated the length of the CGG repeats in the FRM gene by comparing with ladder length during gel electrophoresis

**Battle Ship**
-----------------

<p style="text-align: justify">
Hobby project
<br>
</p>
- Coded a small scale version of the popular game Battle Ships
- Requires you to place 4 ships by inputing row and column coordinates from 1 to 5
- After placement fire at the computer's ships by inputing row and column coordinates from 1 to 5
- (Still requires some debugging)
