**Summary**

"Laa shay'a waqi'un moutlaq bale kouloun moumkine" - The Assassin's Creed

Assassin's Creed is a open world "stealth" action adventure game. Set in 1191, you relive the memories of the Levantine assassin,  Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad. Follow his humbling journey as a novice relearning the ways of the brotherhood and reinventing the order for generations to come all in a quest to establish peace during The Third Crusade.

Altaïr is equipped with one of the most iconic weapons in all of gaming, the hidden blade (kind of ironic I think) along with small variety of arms, and his special skills of persuasion (read whacking people till they speak), deduction, stealth and parkour. Using these and your wit research, locate, identify and eliminate your targets by any means necessary (preferably stealthily).

While the game may not (or may have depending on who you ask) aged well since its release in 2007 (15 years as of this writing), Assassin's Creed remains a classic with an innovative method of integrating into real world history, stunning display of the graphics for its time, impressive worldbuilding and a great start for one of the most iconic game franchise ever made.

**Analysis**
---------

Assassin's Creed is great narrative story about the journey of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a member of the Levantine Brotherhood of Assassin and resident of Masyaf, during 1191, the tail end of The Third Crusade. The game introduces us to the two main warring factions that are prevalent for the rest of the series: The Assassins and The Templars. It also establishes the Pieces of Eden, powerful artefacts made with sophisticated technology made by those who came before us, Humans (no not dinosaurs, this is not Rick and Morty). And finally it sets up the modern day, with the Desmond Miles: the actual player character, the modern day templars: Abstergo, and the animus.


### Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad

Born in Masyaf, the stronghold of the Levantine Assassins, Altaïr was pretty much born into the assassin's brotherhood as his father was also an assassin. Through his natural "talents" and skill, Altaïr quickly raises through the ranks of brotherhood, reaching the rank of Master Assassin at the young age of 25, a feat unheard of for someone so young. As with any such unheard feat, arrogance and hubris followed. Following a botched mission to retrieve an artefact, an Apple of Eden, costing the brotherhood a body and arm (there is a FMA reference here somewhere), he is stripped of his ranks and gear, stabbed and made to relearn the creed and three tenets of the Assassins as a novice.

Our mission now is to eliminate 9 templar agents who know of the existence of the Apple Eden. This hunt spans 3 cities : Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem, and 3 districts within each. With each kill, Altaïr gains a rank and use of more equipment. But more importantly he gains a new perspective of his mission. Each dying man confesses to his goals which sound more benevolent than malevolent albeit in a twisted way. Each one speaks of ending the crusade and attaining peace, which is the same goal as the assassins, even at the cost of betraying the side of the crusade they are on. By the end (**SPOILERS!!**), we learn the mentor of the Assassins, Al-Mualim is also a member of this group of 9 (10 pieces of 9 anyone?) and Altaïr was used as tool to eliminate his opposition to enforce his version of peace using the artefact.


### The Assassins and the Templars

The Assassins and The Templars (not to be confused with the Knights Templar of The Crusades, all though there is not insignificant overlap I believe) are the current names of two ideological factions that have been waring for ages. They are also in effect 2 sides of the same coin; chaos and order. They are united in their goal to achieve global peace, but divided in the ideology and means to attain said goal.

We do not come across much of the Templar ideologies in this instalment. From the little we can gather from the dying words of our targets, The Templars believe humanity need to be shepherded towards unity. Order must be established and the world must be controlled in order to attain peace.

In contrast The Assassins believe in free will, that humanity should achieve peace not through someone or a group enforcing but rather on its own accord. The assassins only wish to be a guiding force rather than the shepherd for humanity. We also learn the creed of the Assassin's which separates them from the Templars. The creed's maxim as stated by the mentor Al-Mualim is
- "Laa shay'a waqi'un moutlaq bale kouloun moumkine", an Arabic phrase that translates to "Nothing is absolute reality, everything is possible" (transition provided by a reliable friend), or in a more general sense as it is said in the later games "Nothing is true, Everything is permitted"

While the statement does sound cynical it is better explained in later games. As for this, Altaïr remarks that its not a command to be free but rather a command to be wise. The Creed's Maxim is accompanied by 3 tenants that capture its (intended) essence:

- Stay your blade from the flesh of the innocent
- Hide in plain sight
- Never compromise the Brotherhood

As a small note, Altaïr breaks all three tenets in the botched mission hence the stabbing, but he is just too good to be killed off so he is demoted. Of course, the brotherhood itself was also breaking the second tenet, a castle at the top of a hill isn't as much hiding in plain sight as its a beacon of your presence. And Altaïr in his new found wisdom rectifies these aspects of the brotherhood and effectively reinvents the brotherhood as its mentor but thats a story for a different game.


### Modern Day

While most of the game is set in 1191, its not the actual setting of the game. The game is set in 2012, and features 3 characters:

- Desmond Miles, the player character, a bartender by profession who is forced into volunteering for a study to locate the artefact, by reliving the memories of his ancestor, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad
- Dr Warren Vidic, a templar and the director of the animus project at Abstergo (the modern day templars).
- Lucy Stillman, assistant to Dr Vidic and sympathetic towards Desmond

This also sets up the animus, a device used to relive the memories of ones ancestors. The fiction of the game says that of the much data stored in the DNA, some of it is memories of our ancestors and the animus lets one access these genetic memories. As someone with some background in biotechnology, I find this concept fascinating but unproven science fiction.


### Integrating into History

One of the key features of Assassin's Creed which sets up with whole franchise is the immense worldbuilding in real life that the game near seamlessly integrates into. All our named target including our mentor are based of real life people who lived (and subsequently died) in the time period shown. The Templar are rooted largely in the Knights Templar of the Crusades. While the Assassins are based on a sub sect of Shia Islam, also called Isma'ilism. Al-Mualim is based of Rashid ad-Din Sinan, known as the Old Man of the Mountain, the leader of the Syrian branch of Isma'ilism and were also known as al-Ḥaššāšīn or Assassins, ruling from the Masyaf castle. Now I not a great history buff and am not bothering with much more research on the topic but I believe for anyone interested the worldbuilding aspect makes for a decent starting point to learn more about the events depicted.


### Personal Criticism

The game is definitely a classic. It sets the foundation for the Assassin's Creed franchise and gives use the some of the most iconic and memorable aspects of the game; the hidden blade, the view points at the top of buildings, the leaps of faith and the hard to resist urge to scale any tall and iconic building. The combat system simple and just hard enough that you want to avoid it taking stealthier route but not so hard that its near impossible to hold yourself in a fight. The navigation in the open world setting by parkouring through ledges and rooftops gives free flowing mobility that is very welcoming and opens up our approach to the targets. This is also one of the few games in the series that actually gets social stealth right with us only being hidden in a group dressed similar to us.

However being the first entry for a now massive franchise its age shows, not due to its own faults but rather due to the success and diversification in the future games. This game is basically 3 minigames in a trench coat 9 times masquerading a game. Its extremely reputative which is noticeable very early on. You travel to a city, complete 2-6 of the investigating quests gathering more and more details about the target and proceed to kill them. That's pretty much it. Compared to later entries that contain side missions, more characterisation and growth of the protagonist, this falls flat. The final issue with the game is it contains 450 collectables in the form of flags and Templars to be killed with no rewards or ways to find making it an unfun, boring, headache inducing task if undertaken.

As a stand alone game in 2007 it would have definitely been a great game all though with little to no replayability. But as time has passed and the games have improved, it feels more like a demo version (for my last obscure reference, like the PlayStation exclusive games Patapon 1 and Patapon 2, where Patapon 2 feels like Patapon 1 and Patapon 1 like Patapon 0.5). For anyone starting the series and/or is unaffected by the expectations set by the successors its definitely a game worth playing.
