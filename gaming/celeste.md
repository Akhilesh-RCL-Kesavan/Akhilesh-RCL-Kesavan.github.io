**Summary**
--------

<br>

This is it, Akhilesh. Just breath. Why are you so nervous. You can do it.

Celeste is an indie precision platformer, with easy to pick up, hard to master controls. You play as Madeline, as she challenges herself to conquer Mount Celeste, to find inspiration in life, while braving her own problems and the perils of climbing a mystical mountain.

With just 3 basic movements: Jumping, Wall Climbing and Dashing, Celeste offers a surprisingly large variety of paths to navigate through its tight platforming as a result of its amazing game physics. Keeping things fresh, each chapter offers a new theme with unique mechanics, obstacles, emotions and a fitting soundtrack.

For the more experienced players seeking a tougher challenge, Celeste offers collectable crystal hearts, cassettes to unlock brutal B sides, and C sides for 8 chapters, a kind of sequel in chapter 9, and a whooping 202 strawberries to impress your friends (P.S. I have developed an immense fondness of strawberries due to this game).

As a whole Celeste is an amazing wholesome experience, with great design, simple graphics, and a real source of introspection and philosophy. I highly recommend the game and believe is a must play.

**Analysis**
---------

This is more of a me projecting my thoughts, relating to the experiences that the characters go through in the game and in general reading way too much into the game. For convivence refer the following meme:

As we are introduced to the mountain at the beginning, we are told that the mountain makes you see things we may not be ready to see. These happen in the form of different manifestations specific to each individual, expressing parts of themselves. It is also said that the mountain only gives form to what is already present within the person. So lets see what each character holds within themselves.

### Mr. Oshiro

Introduced in chapter 3, Celestial Resort, Mr. Oshiro is the concierge and the de facto manager and owner of the Celestial Resort Hotel. He is also a ghost who died about 20 years prior to the events of the game and is haunting in denial.

Through the various books we find in the hotel like the guest entry log book, and Mr. Oshiro's diary along with the general condition of the hotel, we infer that all of the staff had left about 20 years ago when the hotel shutdown due to a reduced number of visitors. This also hints to the time period the city below for forsaken but that's a different story.

Mr. Oshiro had worked his whole life at the resort welcoming and greeting travellers to the hotel. When the hotel shutdown, he could not let it go and choose to stay back an additional day as per his last diary entry. The assumption here is that he died on that day unable to let go and the power of the mountain preserved him as a ghost. Now my small theory here is that Mr. Oshiro as we see him is actually the manifestation of the inability of letting go from Mr. Oshiro. In either case, he has made the hotel his home for the past 20 years largely unable to maintain it and frustrated due to the lack of customers. This eventually I believe lead to his denial which is nothing more than a façade in order to not deal with the reality. This frustration and denial then manifest using the mountains power as dust bunnies (or as a manifestation of a manifestation).

When Theo and Madeline make their way to the hotel, they are the first potential customers in over 2 decades and so Mr. Oshiro tries his best to ensure they stay as long as possible in order to add credence to his denial. While Theo bolts as soon as he realises, Madeline stays to try and help Mr. Oshiro. This however doesn't go as planned as any effort to help him only adds to his insecurities. With Madeline helping him clean up the place, the façade he had created for himself, as the hotel being a luxurious place crumbles forcing him slowly to face the reality he isn't ready to face. So even though Madeline's help was with good intentions, for Mr. Oshiro it only makes his frustration worse. At the end in the presidential suite when Badeline finally calls out his denial, the façade completely breaks and he retaliates by lashing out at Madeline.

In my opinion, people living (or in this case haunting) in denial are very well aware that they are in denial. They choose to live in the safety of the denial, afraid to face the reality. The one thing people in denial really crave is an amount of control over the otherwise uncontrollability of their reality. So while for anyone trying to help them, fixing certain issues or easing them out of the delusion sound like good ideas, they often come of as you trying to make the face the reality but not on their terms. This often leads to them lashing out. So rather help them face it on their own terms. Provide them the means to help themselves and keep checking up on them.

### Theo

Theo is a fellow adventurer, who we meet either in chapter 1, 2 or 3 depending on how we wish to explore the area. Most of our interaction Theo happens during cut-scenes and are largely unaffecting from the mountain's influence. Through the dialogue, we learn that he is a budding photographer here to click pics for his InstaPix account. We also learn that he has hitchhiked his way to the mountain, after leaving a job in Seattle he hated. He had heard about the mountain from his grandfather who had visited it years ago.

From the dialogue, and his manifestations in the mirror temple I assume, Theo feels under pressure and is sensitive of what others think about him. He feels he hasn't figured out his place in the world and is worried about it. Since the only interaction of him with the mountain we see is him being cocooned in a crystal surrounded by multiple eyes following him, I cannot really say much about the extent of his worries. From what we do see, he is very conscious of how others perceive him and tries to cope by sheltering himself from the world. However this sheltering also causes him to feel trapped and unable to move and needs support and help.


### Madeline and Badeline

Considering this is Madeline's story and the amount of time we spend with her, we can infer a lot about her. On a personal note the reason I absolutely love this story is due to how much I find Madeline relatable. In fact the only aspects of Madeline I do not relate to are her coping mechanism of drinking and getting angry at people on the internet, and her being unable to recognise who she saw in a mirror (took me about 2 years to realise this is an allusion to her being trans, (I... hope???)).

Arriving at the foot of the mountain, Madeline is nervous, unsure why she wants to climb to its summit just that she has to. We eventually learn that she also has depressive episodes and panic attacks. As we go up the mountain, the mountain's power manifests her negative feelings and emotions as a doppelgänger, lets call her Badeline for the lack of a better word. Badeline calls herself the pragmatic part of Madeline and urges Madeline to go back. Madeline calls Badeline her lazy or weak part and proceeds up the mountain. Badeline shows up at different parts of the climb, with varying results per encounter; from potentially saving Madeline, to causing a panic attack. Eventually the rift between them worsens to a point where Badeline starts to hurt Madeline.

While I relate to pretty much all it, I particularly sympathise with Badeline, especially since we eventually find she is just scared and grossly misunderstood. She, albeit in a twisted way, was generally trying to look out for Madeline and keep her safe. Her urging of Madeline to give up on the journey was because climbing a mountain is truly a dangerous task. In the hotel, she is upfront with Mr. Oshiro, completely breaking him because Madeline was almost being held hostage due to her guilt. While Badeline's actions had drastic implications, she never truly meant to harm Madeline. She only turns violent against Madeline after being continuously dismissed, blamed for everything bad that happens to Madeline, and Madeline trying to cut her off from herself.

Eventually when Madeline does realise her mistake, she makes an effort to understand Badeline and reaches out to her, acknowledging and accepting her. And it is only through their combined effort that they are able to reach the summit. And in my experience this largely holds true. Anxiety and depression, which Badeline is the personification of aren't the true source of the problems we face but rather our minds trying to protect itself from the consequences of the unknown. They are symptoms of a latent fear in our heads not the cause of the fears. Dismissing them as aspects of your life you do not need is nothing short of a lobotomy in my opinion and your mind fights back, making the symptoms worse.

Don't get me wrong, both anxiety and depression suck, terribly and terrifying suck. You can feel physically sick, or stuck, or like drifting away aimlessly with no respite in sight, with an urge to find something to cling on to regain your footing. The urge to go back to a time when things were simpler, more normal will always be lingering in your head. But they are your mind trying to save you from your fears. Trying to dismiss them makes your mind think of it as betraying itself, and trust me no mind likes that. Instead, try to focus on what the true problem is, the source of your fear is. It will be a hard journey, there will be set backs. But that's alight. You don't have to resolve it in a day. There is no harm in turning back and trying on a day you are better equipped to deal with it, after all Rome wasn't built in a day. To match the allegory of the game, when I initially picked up this game , there were parts of it that were incredibly difficult thanks to my broken controller. As I picked it up again (mostly to write this whole piece) with a controller that wasn't broken, things were a lot easier and smoother. In reality the role of the controller is fulfilled by how you deal with the issue, be it therapy, medication or any other method that helps you.

My experience and as mirrored in Madeline's, talking about it to someone who will listen, goes a long way. In a more general sense, I believe, it is the expression of your thoughts that helps. Someway of pulling the thoughts from the echo chamber of the mind to a more tangible form. Similar to the mountain, giving form to Badeline making it easier to understand and approach your thoughts. Write about it, talk about it, make a video about it, sing or dance about it (IDK?), or heck even make a game about it. Anything that you think will help you. And trust me it doesn't have to be great, just honest and it will help in a meaningful way :).

### Old woman aka Granny

The old woman is very helpful lady living at the base of the mountain. We don't really learn much about her during the first 8 chapters, just that she had travelled here a long time ago to also reach the summit like Madeline, fell in love with the place and decided to live there. She acts as a guide to Madeline on her journey to the summit hinting to the mountain's power and mostly taunting Madeline. However she also believes in Madeline and encourages her to find her own path.

As for the mountain's influence on her, she loves the mountain because it keeps her sharp and true to herself, making her the most well adjusted character in the game (also the reason she can climb the mountain quickly I guess, or its just the lifts). She is also accompanied by a bird at all times, which is probably the manifestation of her love for travel, that she had to compromise on while deciding to stay at the mountain.  

### Mount Celeste

As captain Holt from, Brooklyn 99 would put it if he ever play this, the Mountain, Celeste is a character in itself. It seems to interact with everyone on it in a unique way, with the goal being to help them face themselves, or parts of themselves they are trying to hide from. With Mr. Oshiro its the dust bunnies, with Theo, the eyes, with Madeline and Badeline, each other and with the old women the bird. The mountain is pretty much entirely dedicated towards self reflection, symbolically represented with the mirrors and reflective surfaces handy at key locations including a large Mirror Temple. Another interesting thing I have come to notice while playing the nature of the reflective surfaces also change as we are more susceptible to our self. For most of the game the reflective surfaces are mirrors, which are hard and break if tried to change, similar to the initial relation between Madeline and Badeline. But once Madeline begins to attempt understanding Badeline and by extension herself, we find water that is more malleable and adaptable.

**Plot Synopsis**
---------

<br>

In the span of 7 chapters and about 8 hours of gameplay for the main story, Celeste shows a great story of someone facing a challenge, confronting their fears and ultimately achieving their goal.

### Prologue

Starting with a small prologue acting as the tutorial, we are introduced to Madeline who is nervous about the journey ahead. As we make our way to the start of the trail, we meet an old lady (little did I know at the start that I would end up considering her the most badass character in the whole game) who is one of the few inhabitants of the mountain. After ignoring her advisory about the mountain we head out to the trail where experience the mountains first effect: the ability to dash.

### Forsaken City

The first chapter, Forsaken City is set in, surprise surprise, a forsaken city. As we make our way through the city we may encounter Theo, a fellow climber and aspiring photographer, here to boost his following of his [InstaPix account](https://www.instagram.com/TheoUnderStars/). The general tone of the chapter is upbeat with the accompanying soundtrack, First Steps, filling us optimism, hope and a felling that we can brave anything this mountain will throw at us. As we exit the city we see a memorial honouring those who have perished in the climb and decide to make camp for the night as Madeline starts to have doubts about the adventure.

### Old Ruins

The next chapter begins with waking up in a world that seems a little off. As we head into the old ruins, we are accompanied by the track, Resurrections, an ominous tune that is kind of foreboding but still in a good lets explore kind of way. In the ruins we encounter a mirror with a slightly mismatched reflection. Upon further inspection, the mirror breaks setting the reflection free, and changing the landscape slightly. As we proceed further we meet up with the escaped reflection. The reflection introduces herself as the pragmatic part of Madeline, who has escaped thanks to the power of the mountain. She tries to talk Madeline out of continuing her journey, leading to a chase sequence of us escaping from Badeline. After escaping we receive a call on a nearby payphone and ultimately realize its all but a dream, a bad one. As we awaken, things seem to be back to normal and we may run into Theo a second time, and share our experience. The track, Awake, plays during the awake sequence and in my opinion perfectly captures the feeling of waking up from a nightmare; the confusion, the questions, the mystery and the slow realisation that it was all just a dream and things are going back to normal.

### Celestial Resort

Next up on our trail we end up at the Celestial Resort Hotel. As we enter the resort, we are greeted by the gracious Mr. Oshiro, the concierge of the hotel, which is all well and good except, Mr. Oshiro is a **GHOST!!!!** This is the chapter where we actually get a proper glimpse at the mountain's power, also making it the most annoying (and hard) chapter in the main game. It is also the start of the games philosophy in my opinion starting with Mr. Oshiro's interaction with the mountain. Mr. Oshiro is essentially a spirit "living" in denial about the current state of his much beloved hotel, and lost in the delusion of the glory days about 20 years ago. As we are welcomed in to the sounds of, Checking In, we are filled with a sense of latent caution, and rightly so as the chapter is also significantly harder with moving platforms and obstacles. As we wade through the clutter we can see that Mr. Oshiro is desperate to keep us at the resort as long as possible. But soon his façade starts the crumble as the mess is just too much to ignore. As we help Mr. Oshiro clean up, listening to, Sprit of Hospitality (ironically named I guess), we are back in a upbeat mood but worried about Mr. Oshiro and deep down that caution is still growing. We will also meet Theo as he makes a beeline out of the resort no wishing to engage in this mess. After clearing the mess, as we try to leave, Mr. Oshiro offers us the presidential suite in a last ditch effort to make us stay. As we make our way there, Scattered and Lost, our worries about Mr. Oshiro start tuning to impatience to leave the hotel as soon as possible. This not at all helped by Mr. Oshiro completely starting to loose it. Upon entering the presidential suite, Badeline comes to our "rescue", bursting out of a mirror (I must say I love Badeline's entrances), and bluntly berating Mr. Oshiro and opening a way out. This leads to the second chase sequence of the game with us escaping the now furious Mr. Oshiro, and ending with him breaking a large part of the roof finally coming to terms with the reality.

### Golden Ridge

Following the whole ordeal of Celeste Resort, Golden Ridge is rather pleasant area. After a brief talk with the old lady from the prologue, the chapter is a simple platforming challenge till the end. Most of the perils in the stage are essentially a representation of the dangers of mountain climbing. The soundtrack, Golden, however, points to a different story. Madeline is still hung up on her encounter with Mr. Oshiro. With events of the previous chapters she is unsure of her endeavour. The track is slower, filled more with a feeling of dread or anxiousness compared to First Steps from Forsaken City, that I feel the stage shares some level design aspects with. As we progress through the stage, the tension so to say keeps building and the track keeps getting louder. Its finally resolved at the end of stage where we meet up with Theo again. Together we get on to a gondola to go further. At this point Madeline starts to panic, fearing the how safe the gondola is. With small snag in the ride, Madeline has a full panic attack. She starts to think this whole thing was a big mistake. The world is closing in on her making it very claustrophobic. Thankfully Theo is around to help us, teaching a way to help control Madeline's breathing and calming her. The track aptly named, Anxiety, really pulls us into the immersive experience, from the build up, to the uneasiness and winding back down. Soon the gondola resumes its course delivering us to the next area.

### Mirror Temple

After catching our breath, we make our way into the Mirror Temple. Now to put it bluntly, the Mirror Temple is a terrifying place. Its a large, dark and mysterious. As for the soundtrack its, Quite and Falling, it captures the mystery and anxiety one would associate with a mysterious temple on magical mountain. It also captures Madeline's uncertainty with her decision to continue climbing the mountain. As we navigate through the temple we find Theo trapped in a mirror. As it turns of the mountain's power is really strong with in the temple (who would have thought a temple of all places) and it has a thing for mirrors. As we search for a way to save Theo, we uncover a large broken mirror and trap ourselves in the mirror dimension along with ever more manifestations from Madeline's head. The aesthetic of the temple also change, matching Madeline's manifestations. The rooms are also much brighter but in a way that we are aware of the danger ahead. The sound, In The Mirror adding to the eeriness of the new landscape (p.s. this soundtrack also has a hidden message in it adding to the creepiness). Madeline is genuinely freaked out now, almost convinced the mountain was a bad idea and Theo is trapped because of her. She even pleads with Badeline to help her, only to be dismissed by Badeline saying she deserves this for not listening to her earlier. After some more navigation while evading the monstrous manifestations called seakers, we get some time to reflect on our situation (in front of a mirror again, I swear the symbolism is starting to get too on the nose here). Soon Madeline decides to focus on finding a saving Theo rather than deal with her feeling like a trespasser in her own head. We eventually find Theo trapped in a crystal unable to move. As Madeline starts to blame herself for the entire fiasco, Theo consoles her that the crystals and **(Trypophobia Alert)** all the eyes surrounding them are his manifestations and not Madeline's fault. After making our way to Theo, we carry him (Madeline can LIFT!!!) to the end, throw him into a giant eyeball and end our nightmare, escaping temple.

### Reflection

Exhausted from the escape, Theo and Madeline make camp for the night. After some dialogue with Theo about the climb, we fall asleep. In our dream world fly to confront (to the hopefully anxious track Starjump) Badeline and pretty much tell Badeline to get lost (Anyone who has actually done will know its a terrible idea). Enraged Badeline throws us off the mountain. And thus begins the most crucial chapter of the plot, Reflection. As with all chapter titles, Reflection indicates what we will be dealing with, ourselves. Its also unique in that it isn't named after a location on the mountain. As we find our way through the unnamed section of the mountain, (I assume from the song, Reflection) Madeline is reflecting on the events of the past couple of days. You get a sense that she has accepted that she cannot make the climb, at least not in her present state, with a part of her acting completely against her. Along the way she also realises that she has really mistreated Badeline, not understanding her and blaming her for all their problems. As we run into the old lady again who helps us understand just what the mountain's power, Madeline is determined to confront Badeline again and do so in a more understanding manner. After a brief search and the only battle sequence (to the amazing boss battle music, Confronting Myself) with Badeline, we finally come to terms with her. This self-acceptance literally doubles our power enabling us to double dash. Soon we climb back to the area we fell off from. During this section the track Little Goth is played which has the feeling acceptance attached to it. Upon reuniting with Theo and the old lady we prepare for the final leg of the journey.

### Summit

Unburdened from the weight Madeline had been carrying till now (mentally Badeline, physically the backpack), we make our way to the Summit of Mount Celeste. Madeline is in sync with Badeline and is now for the first time since the start seems confident that she can do it (Maybe projection but honestly the sprite of Madeline without her backpack and with the extended pink hair just exudes confidence). The whole final trek is the mountain testing us as to what have we learnt in our journey. Every 500M we get a rehashed sequence of the previous chapters with Badeline boosting us at each transition. The music, Reach for the Summit, imbues the same confidence and can do attitude. Similar to the level design, the track features a remixed version relevant chapter in an upbeat tune. With each transition Madeline and Badeline get closer to being on the same page, with dialogue, understanding and even encouraging each other. As we reach to peak, Madeline and Badeline put their differences past them and accept them for who they are. And we have done it!! WE HAVE CONQURED MOUNT CELESTE!!!!

As the credits roll, we see Madeline and Badeline make their way back down, now as friends and enjoying the trek instead of the stress and anxiety they had on the way up. Along the way we also see Mr. Oshiro has finally accepted his reality and is working on improving himself and the hotel with the help of his dust bunnies. The entire journey down portraying the magic of the new found friendship and acceptance is wonderfully covered in the closing out track, Exhale.

### Epilogue

Now that the Journey is done, everyone celebrates with some strawberry cake Madeline bakes with the strawberries she has collected.
