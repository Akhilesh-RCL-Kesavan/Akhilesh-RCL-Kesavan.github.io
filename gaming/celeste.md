**Prologue**
--------

<br>

This is it, Akhilesh. Just breath. Why are you so nervous. You can do it.

Celeste is an indie precision platformer, with easy to pick up, hard to master controls. You play as Madeline, as she challenges herself to conquer Mount Celeste, to find inspiration in life, while braving her own problems and the perils of climbing a mystical mountain.

With just 3 basic movements: Jumping, Wall Climbing and Dashing, Celeste offers a surprisingly large variety of paths to navigate through its tight platforming as a result of its amazing game physics. Keeping things fresh, each chapter offers a new theme with unique mechanics, obstacles, emotions and a fitting soundtrack.

For the more experienced players seeking a tougher challenge, Celeste offers collectable crystal hearts, cassettes to unlock brutal B sides, and C sides for 8 chapters, a kind of sequel in chapter 9, and a whooping 202 strawberries to impress your friends (P.S. I have developed an immense fondness of strawberries due to this game).

As a whole Celeste is an amazing wholesome experience, with great design, simple graphics, and a real source of introspection and philosophy. I highly recommend the game and believe is a must play.

**Design and Philosophy**
---------

<br>

In the span of 8 chapters and about 8 hours of gameplay for the main story, Celeste shows a great story of someone facing a challenge, confronting their fears and ultimately achieving their goal.

Starting with a small prologue acting as the tutorial, we are introduced to Madeline who is nervous about the journey ahead. As we make our way to the start of the trail, we meet an old lady (little did I know at the start that I would end up considering her the most badass character in the whole game) who is one of the few inhabitants of the mountain. After ignoring her advisory about the mountain we head out to the trail where experience the mountains first effect: the ability to dash.
