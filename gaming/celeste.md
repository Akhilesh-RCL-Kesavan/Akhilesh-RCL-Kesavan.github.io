**Prologue**
--------

<br>

This is it, Akhilesh. Just breath. Why are you so nervous. You can do it.

Celeste is an indie precision platformer, with easy to pick up, hard to master controls. You play as Madeline, as she challenges herself to conquer Mount Celeste, to find inspiration in life, while braving her own problems and the perils of climbing a mystical mountain.

With just 3 basic movements: Jumping, Wall Climbing and Dashing, Celeste offers a surprisingly large variety of paths to navigate through its tight platforming as a result of its amazing game physics. Keeping things fresh, each chapter offers a new theme with unique mechanics, obstacles, emotions and a fitting soundtrack.

For the more experienced players seeking a tougher challenge, Celeste offers collectable crystal hearts, cassettes to unlock brutal B sides, and C sides for 8 chapters, a kind of sequel in chapter 9, and a whooping 202 strawberries to impress your friends (P.S. I have developed an immense fondness of strawberries due to this game).

As a whole Celeste is an amazing wholesome experience, with great design, simple graphics, and a real source of introspection and philosophy. I highly recommend the game and believe is a must play.

In the span of 7 chapters and about 8 hours of gameplay for the main story, Celeste shows a great story of someone facing a challenge, confronting their fears and ultimately achieving their goal.

### Tutorial

Starting with a small prologue acting as the tutorial, we are introduced to Madeline who is nervous about the journey ahead. As we make our way to the start of the trail, we meet an old lady (little did I know at the start that I would end up considering her the most badass character in the whole game) who is one of the few inhabitants of the mountain. After ignoring her advisory about the mountain we head out to the trail where experience the mountains first effect: the ability to dash.

### Forsaken City

The first chapter, Forsaken City is set in, surprise surprise, a forsaken city. As we make your way through the city we may encounter Theo, a fellow climber and aspiring photographer, here to boost his following of his [InstaPix account](https://www.instagram.com/TheoUnderStars/). The general tone of the chapter is upbeat with the accompanying soundtrack, First Steps, filling us optimism, hope and a felling that we can brave anything this mountain will throw at us. As we exit the city we see a memorial honouring those who have perished in the climb and decide to make camp for the night as Madeline starts to have doubts about the adventure.

### Old Ruins

The next chapter begins with waking up in a world that seems a little off. As we head into the old ruins, we are accompanied by the track, Resurrections, an ominous tune that is kind of foreboding but still in a good lets explore kind of way. In the ruins we encounter a mirror with a slightly mismatched reflection. Upon further inspection, the mirror breaks setting the reflection free, and changing the landscape slightly. As we proceed further we meet up with the escaped reflection. The reflection introduces herself as the pragmatic part of Madeline, (lets call her Badeline although I don't really agree), who has escaped thanks to the power of the mountain. She tries to talk Madeline out of continuing her journey, leading to a chase sequence of us escaping from Badeline. After escaping we receive a call on a nearby payphone and ultimately realize its all but a dream, a bad one. As we awaken, things seem to be back to normal and we may run into Theo a second time, and share our experience. The track, Awake, plays during the awake sequence and in my opinion perfectly captures the feeling of waking up from a nightmare; the confusion, the questions, the mystery and the slow realisation that it was all just a dream and things are going back to normal.

### Celestial Resort

Next up on our trail we end up at the Celestial Resort Hotel. As we enter the resort, we are greeted by the gracious Mr. Oshiro, the concierge of the hotel, which is all well and good except, Mr. Oshiro is a **GHOST!!!!** This is the chapter where we actually get a proper glimpse at the mountain's power, also making it the most annoying (and hard) chapter in the main game. It is also the start of the games philosophy in my opinion starting with Mr. Oshiro's interaction with the mountain. Mr. Oshiro is essentially a spirit "living" in denial about the current state of his much beloved hotel, and lost in the delusion of the glory days about 20 years ago. As we are welcomed in to the sounds of, Checking In, we are filled with a sense of latent caution, and rightly so as the chapter is also significantly harder with moving platforms and obstacles. As we wade through the clutter we can see that Mr. Oshiro is desperate to keep us at the resort as long as possible. But soon his fa√ßade starts the crumble as the mess is just too much to ignore. As we help Mr. Oshiro clean up, listening to, Sprit of Hospitality (ironically named I guess), we are back in a upbeat mood but worried about Mr. Oshiro and deep down that caution is still growing. We will also meet Theo as he makes a beeline out of the resort no wishing to engage in this mess. After clearing the mess, as we try to leave, Mr. Oshiro offers us the presidential suite in a last ditch effort to make us stay. As we make our way there, Scattered and Lost, our worries about Mr. Oshiro start tuning to impatience to leave the hotel as soon as possible. This not at all helped by Mr. Oshiro completely starting to loose it. Upon entering the presidential suite, Badeline comes to our "rescue", bursting out of a mirror (I must say I love Badeline's entrances), and bluntly berating Mr. Oshiro and opening a way out. This leads to the second chase sequence of the game with us escaping the now furious Mr. Oshiro, and ending with him breaking a large part of the roof finally coming to terms with the reality.
