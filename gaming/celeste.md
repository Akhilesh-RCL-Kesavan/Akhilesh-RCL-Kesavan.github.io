**Summary**
--------

<br>

This is it, Akhilesh. Just breath. Why are you so nervous. You can do it.

Celeste is an indie precision platformer, with easy to pick up, hard to master controls. You play as Madeline, as she challenges herself to conquer Mount Celeste, to find inspiration in life, while braving her own problems and the perils of climbing a mystical mountain.

With just 3 basic movements: Jumping, Wall Climbing and Dashing, Celeste offers a surprisingly large variety of paths to navigate through its tight platforming as a result of its amazing game physics. Keeping things fresh, each chapter offers a new theme with unique mechanics, obstacles, emotions and a fitting soundtrack.

For the more experienced players seeking a tougher challenge, Celeste offers collectable crystal hearts, cassettes to unlock brutal B sides, and C sides for 8 chapters, a kind of sequel in chapter 9, and a whooping 202 strawberries to impress your friends (P.S. I have developed an immense fondness of strawberries due to this game).

As a whole Celeste is an amazing wholesome experience, with great design, simple graphics, and a real source of introspection and philosophy. I highly recommend the game and believe is a must play.

In the span of 7 chapters and about 8 hours of gameplay for the main story, Celeste shows a great story of someone facing a challenge, confronting their fears and ultimately achieving their goal.

### Prologue

Starting with a small prologue acting as the tutorial, we are introduced to Madeline who is nervous about the journey ahead. As we make our way to the start of the trail, we meet an old lady (little did I know at the start that I would end up considering her the most badass character in the whole game) who is one of the few inhabitants of the mountain. After ignoring her advisory about the mountain we head out to the trail where experience the mountains first effect: the ability to dash.

### Forsaken City

The first chapter, Forsaken City is set in, surprise surprise, a forsaken city. As we make our way through the city we may encounter Theo, a fellow climber and aspiring photographer, here to boost his following of his [InstaPix account](https://www.instagram.com/TheoUnderStars/). The general tone of the chapter is upbeat with the accompanying soundtrack, First Steps, filling us optimism, hope and a felling that we can brave anything this mountain will throw at us. As we exit the city we see a memorial honouring those who have perished in the climb and decide to make camp for the night as Madeline starts to have doubts about the adventure.

### Old Ruins

The next chapter begins with waking up in a world that seems a little off. As we head into the old ruins, we are accompanied by the track, Resurrections, an ominous tune that is kind of foreboding but still in a good lets explore kind of way. In the ruins we encounter a mirror with a slightly mismatched reflection. Upon further inspection, the mirror breaks setting the reflection free, and changing the landscape slightly. As we proceed further we meet up with the escaped reflection. The reflection introduces herself as the pragmatic part of Madeline, (lets call her Badeline although I don't really agree), who has escaped thanks to the power of the mountain. She tries to talk Madeline out of continuing her journey, leading to a chase sequence of us escaping from Badeline. After escaping we receive a call on a nearby payphone and ultimately realize its all but a dream, a bad one. As we awaken, things seem to be back to normal and we may run into Theo a second time, and share our experience. The track, Awake, plays during the awake sequence and in my opinion perfectly captures the feeling of waking up from a nightmare; the confusion, the questions, the mystery and the slow realisation that it was all just a dream and things are going back to normal.

### Celestial Resort

Next up on our trail we end up at the Celestial Resort Hotel. As we enter the resort, we are greeted by the gracious Mr. Oshiro, the concierge of the hotel, which is all well and good except, Mr. Oshiro is a **GHOST!!!!** This is the chapter where we actually get a proper glimpse at the mountain's power, also making it the most annoying (and hard) chapter in the main game. It is also the start of the games philosophy in my opinion starting with Mr. Oshiro's interaction with the mountain. Mr. Oshiro is essentially a spirit "living" in denial about the current state of his much beloved hotel, and lost in the delusion of the glory days about 20 years ago. As we are welcomed in to the sounds of, Checking In, we are filled with a sense of latent caution, and rightly so as the chapter is also significantly harder with moving platforms and obstacles. As we wade through the clutter we can see that Mr. Oshiro is desperate to keep us at the resort as long as possible. But soon his fa√ßade starts the crumble as the mess is just too much to ignore. As we help Mr. Oshiro clean up, listening to, Sprit of Hospitality (ironically named I guess), we are back in a upbeat mood but worried about Mr. Oshiro and deep down that caution is still growing. We will also meet Theo as he makes a beeline out of the resort no wishing to engage in this mess. After clearing the mess, as we try to leave, Mr. Oshiro offers us the presidential suite in a last ditch effort to make us stay. As we make our way there, Scattered and Lost, our worries about Mr. Oshiro start tuning to impatience to leave the hotel as soon as possible. This not at all helped by Mr. Oshiro completely starting to loose it. Upon entering the presidential suite, Badeline comes to our "rescue", bursting out of a mirror (I must say I love Badeline's entrances), and bluntly berating Mr. Oshiro and opening a way out. This leads to the second chase sequence of the game with us escaping the now furious Mr. Oshiro, and ending with him breaking a large part of the roof finally coming to terms with the reality.

### Golden Ridge

Following the whole ordeal of Celeste Resort, Golden Ridge is rather pleasant area. After a brief talk with the old lady from the prologue, the chapter is a simple platforming challenge till the end. Most of the perils in the stage are essentially a representation of the dangers of mountain climbing. The soundtrack, Golden, however, points to a different story. Madeline is still hung up on her encounter with Mr. Oshiro. With events of the previous chapters she is unsure of her endeavour. The track is slower, filled more with a feeling of dread or anxiousness compared to First Steps from Forsaken City, that I feel the stage shares some level design aspects with. As we progress through the stage, the tension so to say keeps building and the track keeps getting louder. Its finally resolved at the end of stage where we meet up with Theo again. Together we get on to a gondola to go further. At this point Madeline starts to panic, fearing the how safe the gondola is. With small snag in the ride, Madeline has a full panic attack. She starts to think this whole thing was a big mistake. The world is closing in on her making it very claustrophobic. Thankfully Theo is around to help us, teaching a way to help control Madeline's breathing and calming her. The track aptly named, Anxiety, really pulls us into the immersive experience, from the build up, to the uneasiness and winding back down. Soon the gondola resumes its course delivering us to the next area.

### Mirror Temple

After catching our breath, we make our way into the Mirror Temple. Now to put it bluntly, the Mirror Temple is a terrifying place. Its a large, dark and mysterious. As for the soundtrack its, Quite and Falling, it captures the mystery and anxiety one would associate with a mysterious temple on magical mountain. It also captures Madeline's uncertainty with her decision to continue climbing the mountain. As we navigate through the temple we find Theo trapped in a mirror. As it turns of the mountain's power is really strong with in the temple (who would have thought a temple of all places) and it has a thing for mirrors. As we search for a way to save Theo, we uncover a large broken mirror and trap ourselves in the mirror dimension along with ever more manifestations from Madeline's head. The aesthetic of the temple also change, matching Madeline's manifestations. The rooms are also much brighter but in a way that we are aware of the danger ahead. The sound, In The Mirror adding to the eeriness of the new landscape (p.s. this soundtrack also has a hidden message in it adding to the creepiness). Madeline is genuinely freaked out now, almost convinced the mountain was a bad idea and Theo is trapped because of her. She even pleads with Badeline to help her, only to be dismissed by Badeline saying she deserves this for not listening to her earlier. After some more navigation while evading the monstrous manifestations called seakers, we get some time to reflect on our situation (in front of a mirror again, I swear the symbolism is starting to get too on the nose here). Soon Madeline decides to focus on finding a saving Theo rather than deal with her feeling like a trespasser in her own head. We eventually find Theo trapped in a crystal unable to move. As Madeline starts to blame herself for the entire fiasco, Theo consoles her that the crystals and **(Trypophobia Alert)** all the eyes surrounding them are his manifestations and not Madeline's fault. After making our way to Theo, we carry him (Madeline can LIFT!!!) to the end, throw him into a giant eyeball and end our nightmare, escaping temple.

### Reflection

Exhausted from the escape, Theo and Madeline make camp for the night. After some dialogue with Theo about the climb, we fall asleep. In our dream world fly to confront (to the hopefully anxious track Starjump) Badeline and pretty much tell Badeline to get lost (Anyone who has actually done will know its a terrible idea). Enraged Badeline throws us off the mountain. And thus begins the most crucial chapter of the plot, Reflection. As with all chapter titles, Reflection indicates what we will be dealing with, ourselves. Its also unique in that it isn't named after a location on the mountain. As we find our way through the unnamed section of the mountain, (I assume from the song, Reflection) Madeline is reflecting on the events of the past couple of days. You get a sense that she has accepted that she cannot make the climb, at least not in her present state, with a part of her acting completely against her. Along the way she also realises that she has really mistreated Badeline, not understanding her and blaming her for all their problems. As we run into the old lady again who helps us understand just what the mountain's power, Madeline is determined to confront Badeline again and do so in a more understanding manner. After a brief search and the only battle sequence (to the amazing boss battle music, Confronting Myself) with Badeline, we finally come to terms with her. This self-acceptance literally doubles our power enabling us to double dash. Soon we climb back to the area we fell off from. During this section the track Little Goth is played which has the feeling acceptance attached to it. Upon reuniting with Theo and the old lady we prepare for the final leg of the journey.

### Summit

Unburdened from the weight Madeline had been carrying till now (mentally Badeline, physically the backpack), we make our way to the Summit of Mount Celeste. Madeline is in sync with Badeline and is now for the first time since the start seems confident that she can do it (Maybe projection but honestly the sprite of Madeline without her backpack and with the extended pink hair just exudes confidence). The whole final trek is the mountain testing us as to what have we learnt in our journey. Every 500M we get a rehashed sequence of the previous chapters with Badeline boosting us at each transition. The music, Reach for the Summit, imbues the same confidence and can do attitude. Similar to the level design, the track features a remixed version relevant chapter in an upbeat tune. With each transition Madeline and Badeline get closer to being on the same page, with dialogue, understanding and even encouraging each other. As we reach to peak, Madeline and Badeline put their differences past them and accept them for who they are. And we have done it!! WE HAVE CONQURED MOUNT CELESTE!!!!

As the credits roll, we see Madeline and Badeline make their way back down, now as friends and enjoying the trek instead of the stress and anxiety they had on the way up. Along the way we also see Mr. Oshiro has finally accepted his reality and is working on improving himself and the hotel with the help of his dust bunnies. The entire journey down portraying the magic of the new found friendship and acceptance is wonderfully covered in the closing out track, Exhale.
